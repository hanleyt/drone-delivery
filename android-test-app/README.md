# Android Controller

This is an android module that interacts with the Parrot SDK and contains samples from their github samples repo.

https://github.com/Parrot-Developers/Samples/tree/master/Android/SDKSample/

It contains a sample app that can discover multiple types of drones, connect to them, and fly them.

It can communicate with our mambo drone over bluetooth via the MiniDrone class and the MiniDroneActivity.
